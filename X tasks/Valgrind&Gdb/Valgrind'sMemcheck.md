When the programmer runs this code in valgrind, the first error is

``
Invalid write of size 8
at 0x400788: main (broken.c:16)
Address 0x51fc108 is 0 bytes after a block of size 8 alloc'd
at 0x4C2AB80: malloc (in ...)
by 0x4C2CF1F: realloc (in ...)
by 0x400759: main (broken.c:15)
``

在程序的第15行，存在一个内存分配的问题：

``` array = realloc(array, n * sizeof(*array)); ```

这个问题在于 realloc 函数只为 n 个元素分配了内存，而在第16行：

``` array[n] = strtol(line, NULL, 0); ```

程序试图访问 array[n]，这是超出分配内存范围的，因为数组的有效索引范围是 0 到 n-1。这导致了无效的内存写入。

具体来说，第15行的问题是没有为 n+1 个元素分配内存，而第16行的问题是试图写入超出分配内存范围的地址。这会导致程序在运行时出现内存访问错误。

Given the Valgrind error message, the issue is that array[n] is out of bounds because realloc only allocates memory for n elements, but array[n] tries to access the n-th element, which is beyond the allocated memory.

The correct fix is to ensure that the memory allocation accounts for the new element before accessing it. Therefore, the correct change is:

Option 1: Change line 16 to:

``` array[n-1] = strtol(line, NULL, 0); ```

then try to Vlgrind again, the output will be as following.

``` gcc -g -o Val Valgrind'sMemcheck.c ```

```  % valgrind --vgdb=yes --vgdb-error=0 ./Val ```
