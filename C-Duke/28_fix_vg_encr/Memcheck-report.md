// how to save output of command lines in unix terminal?

// below does't work
// ``` valgrind --track-origins=yes ./encrypt 7 input.txt | tee Memcheck-report.md ```
// ``` valgrind --track-origins=yes ./encrypt 7 input.txt >> Memcheck-report.md ```

// below does work
// ``` script Memcheck-report.md ```
// ``` valgrind --track-origins=yes ./encrypt 7 input.txt ```
// after finish the job, input ``` exit ``, otherwise the
