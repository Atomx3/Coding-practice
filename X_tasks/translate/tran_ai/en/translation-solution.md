## Translation Solution

Due to the presence of members from 15 different language backgrounds in our church community, I have identified several issues:

1. Some members' speeches are too long, taking up time from others.
2. Some translation devices are damaged, malfunctioning, or have depleted batteries, rendering them unusable.
3. Noise from the translation device's headphones or microphones, coupled with unclear speech from the translation staff, makes it difficult for the audience to hear or understand.

These issues limit the quality of our church's Sunday services. Therefore, I have considered implementing a translation solution using AI robots.

This solution offers the following advantages:

1. It can translate over 100 languages with virtually unlimited word count. Currently, the average translation accuracy reaches the level of a language master's student, and it requires no cost investment.
2. It can calculate the word count of the speech before the speaker takes the stage and estimate the time required for the speech, facilitating the control of the event flow.

This is the first draft. Since the source document is in simplified Chinese, some sections of my content use simplified slang, making the English and German translations appear somewhat awkward. I will continue to optimize the source document, but I am eager to share it with my brothers now.

Additionally, I need to write several different versions of the document:

- 1 poster (no more than 3 pages, 100 words)
- 1 user manual (no more than 10 pages, 3000 words, for users including landlords, tenants, and preachers)

Then, I will hold a public roadshow presentation with the above documents.
