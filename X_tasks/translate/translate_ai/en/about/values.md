## More Analogies from Different Cultures

Here are some common sayings in ancient and modern Chinese contexts, often used to describe two distinct attitudes towards life.

## Positive and Proactive

- "[君子必慎其所居，择邻而居。 jūnzǐ bì shèn qí suǒ jū, zé lín ér jū] A gentleman is careful about where he lives and chooses his neighbors."

Explanation: The environment can influence a person's temperament and well-being, so a gentleman must carefully choose where to live, selecting good neighbors and surroundings.

- "[修身、齐家、治国、平天下 xiūshēn, qíjiā, zhìguó, píngtiānxià] Cultivate yourself, harmonize your family, govern the nation, and bring peace to the world."

Explanation: These four stages of life emphasize the ideal of gradually expanding self-cultivation and social responsibility, as well as the impact of personal cultivation on family, nation, and the world.

 - "[修身 xiūshēn] Cultivate yourself": First, cultivate your own character and qualities to achieve physical and mental integrity.
 - "[治国 zhìguó] Govern the nation": On the basis of family harmony, have the ability to govern the country and make it stable and prosperous.
 - "[平天下 píngtiānxià] Bring peace to the world": The ultimate goal is to achieve universal harmony and world peace.


## Negative and Passive

- "[躺平、得过且过、随遇而安 tǎngpíng, déguòqiěguò, suíyù'ér'ān] Lying flat, muddling through, going with the flow"

Explanation: Lack of ambition, lack of plans and goals, not pursuing higher goals, just seeking to get by, not making extra efforts, lacking motivation and ambition, only focusing on immediate survival without considering long-term planning and development.

- "[苟且偷生 gǒuqiě tōushēng] To live a wretched existence"

Explanation: It describes a person who disregards dignity or justice in order to survive, exhibiting a negative and cowardly attitude towards life. This idiom has a derogatory meaning, referring to an attitude towards life that is unambitious, passive, and solely focused on survival at the expense of principles in the face of difficulties.



## [此生能无憾矣！cǐshēng néng wúhàn yǐ!]  A life without regrets!

Unfortunately,

we cannot change the larger social environment outside,

but we can change the small environment of our own lives.

If we can't even manage what's inside our own walls,
