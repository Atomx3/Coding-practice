# Translation Solution

Since our church community has members with 15 native languages, I have identified some problems:
1. Some members' speeches are too long, taking up other people's time;
2. Some translation machines are damaged or malfunctioning, and their batteries are exhausted, resulting in their inability to function properly;
3. Due to the noise from the headphones or microphones of the translation machines and the unclear speech of the translation staff, the audience cannot hear or understand clearly;

These problems limit the quality of the church's Sunday services, so I considered using a translation AI robot to create a translation solution.

This solution has the following advantages:
1. It can translate more than 100 languages, with almost unlimited words and phrases. Currently, the average translation accuracy rate has reached the level of a professional master's student in language, and there is no need for cost investment;
2. It can calculate the number of words and phrases in the speech before the speaker takes the stage, and estimate the time required for the speech, which is convenient for controlling the activity process;


This is the first draft. Since the language of the source document is Simplified Chinese, some of my chapters use simplified slang, so some of the content translated into English and German looks a bit strange. I will continue to optimize the source document, but I can't wait to show it to my brothers.

In addition, I need to write several different versions of the document:
- 1 poster (no more than 3 pages and 100 words)
- 1 instruction manual (no more than 10 pages and 3000 words, users include landlords, tenants, and preachers);

Then, I will give a public speech with the above documents.
